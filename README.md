# House-price-prediction
In this machine learning model, sale price will be predicted using mean sale price but since mean sale price prediction model doesn't give correct values as it only predict mean  of all the sale price without considering other independent variables. You can see difference between original sale price and mean sale price by plot which is output of this file.
Currently i am working on linear regression model. Will upload it soon.
